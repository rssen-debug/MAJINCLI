/**
 * MAJIN V4 — memory retrieval for a turn.
 *
 * MAJIN shipped `memory_save` and `memory_search` as tools, but nothing loaded
 * memory into a new turn. The model would have to decide to search before it
 * knew anything worth searching for, so a saved preference was write-only in
 * practice.
 *
 * This module answers one question: which few memories belong in this prompt?
 *
 * Retrieval is V2's `MemoryStore.search()` — ranked substring search over text
 * and tags. It is deliberately not replaced by embeddings: the store's own
 * contract says a semantic upgrade rides the same API, so swapping in a better
 * ranker later changes this file and nothing else.
 *
 * Two rules keep the prompt small and honest:
 *   1. a hard cap on how many entries and how many characters are injected
 *   2. entries are labelled as the owner's stored notes, never as instructions
 *      that outrank the system prompt (a memory is user data, not a directive)
