# MAJIN V4 — private deployment

Goal: a private HTTPS URL that only you can open, pointing at the MAJIN host on
your Windows PC. No port forwarding, no RDP, no public API surface.

> This document is honest about what has been verified. The scripts exist and
> were reviewed; the tunnel steps require **your** Cloudflare account and have
> **not** been executed in this environment. Steps marked ⚠ require you.

## 0. Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11, Node.js **22 LTS** (`node -v`)
- The MAJIN repo cloned, e.g. `C:\MAJINCLI`
- Your existing MAJIN V1 providers/keys already configured on that machine
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\MAJIN\config.json`, or `MAJIN_CONFIG`)

## 1. Start the host (verified locally)

```powershell
cd C:\MAJINCLI
npm ci
npm run v4:doctor
npm run v4
```

The console prints a pairing code **once**. Copy it to the phone when you open
the URL — never into chat, e-mail or a ticket.

Default bind is `127.0.0.1:7373`. That is deliberate: nothing outside the machine
can reach it until a tunnel exists.

## 2. Automatic start at logon (script written, not run on Windows here)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\v4\install-v4-windows.ps1 -AutoStart
```

This registers a **per-user** Scheduled Task at logon with restart-on-failure.
It does not create a service account and does not change machine-wide settings.

Remove it with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\v4\install-v4-windows.ps1 -Uninstall
```

## 3. Cloudflare Tunnel ⚠ (owner action)

Assumes a domain you control is on Cloudflare (free plan is enough).

```powershell
winget install --id Cloudflare.cloudflared
cloudflared tunnel login                       # browser, pick your domain
cloudflared tunnel create majin-v4
cloudflared tunnel route dns majin-v4 majin.DIN-DOMAN.se
```

Config file `%USERPROFILE%\.cloudflared\config.yml`:

```yaml
tunnel: majin-v4
credentials-file: C:\Users\<you>\.cloudflared\<tunnel-id>.json
ingress:
  - hostname: majin.DIN-DOMAN.se
    service: http://127.0.0.1:7373
  - service: http_status:404
```

Run it as a user service so it survives logout:

```powershell
cloudflared service install
```

Then start MAJIN with the public origin and proxy trust:

```powershell
setx MAJIN_V4_PUBLIC_ORIGIN "https://majin.DIN-DOMAN.se"
setx MAJIN_V4_TRUST_PROXY "1"
```

Restart the host task. `npm run v4:doctor` should now show `public_origin OK`.

If your tunnel uses rotating subdomains, allow the family instead of one name:

```powershell
setx MAJIN_V4_ALLOWED_HOSTS "*.din-doman.se"
```

A wildcard entry only matches real subdomains — `*.din-doman.se` matches
`majin.din-doman.se` but never `din-doman.se` or `evildin-doman.se`.

## 4. Put an identity gate in front (Cloudflare Access) ⚠

Cloudflare dashboard → Zero Trust → Access → Applications → **Add an application
(Self-hosted)**:

- Domain: `majin.DIN-DOMAN.se`
- Policy: `Allow` → **Emails** → your address only (or your Google/Apple login)
- Session duration: 24 h (or your preference)

Now the URL requires an IdP login **and** MAJIN's own pairing session. Two
independent gates. Tailscale is the documented fallback: install Tailscale on
the PC and phone, keep MAJIN bound to `127.0.0.1`, and reach it over the tailnet
(`http://<pc-name>:7373`). Tailscale-only means no public URL at all — that is a
feature for a private release, not a limitation to hide.

## 4.5 Run it supervised (recommended)

```powershell
npm run v4:serve:supervised
```

The supervisor restarts the host after a crash with backoff, gives up loudly after five
restarts inside ten minutes, and writes one JSON line per event to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\MAJIN\v4\logs\supervisor-<date>.jsonl`. Ctrl+C stops it for good.

## 5. First phone run (acceptance)

1. Open `https://majin.DIN-DOMAN.se` in Safari/Chrome.
2. Pass the Access login.
3. Enter the pairing code from step 1.
4. Add to home screen (iOS: Share → Add to Home Screen; Android: ⋮ → Install app).
5. Send: `Skriv filen test.txt med innehåll: hej från telefonen`.
6. Expect a tool card that turns green **verified on disk**, then the answer.
7. Lock the phone, reopen: the conversation is still there.

Then run the automated gate and paste its output into `docs/v4/TEST_EVIDENCE.md`:

```powershell
npm run v4:accept -- --url https://majin.DIN-DOMAN.se --write
```

It exits non-zero if anything fails, and it will not claim a model while none is configured.
The matrix points H3/H4 stay unearned until that evidence exists.

## 6. Backup, update, rollback

```powershell
# backup: a verified bundle (conversations, goals, memory — never keys or sessions)
npm run v4:backup -- backup
npm run v4:backup -- verify "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\MAJIN\v4-backups\<stamp>"

# restore onto this or another machine (pair the phone again afterwards)
npm run v4:backup -- restore "<bundle dir>" --dry-run
npm run v4:backup -- restore "<bundle dir>" --force

# update: gates on install -> doctor -> tests -> matrix, rolls back on failure
npm run v4:upgrade -- --dry     # see the plan
npm run v4:upgrade

# manual rollback if you ever need it
cd C:\MAJINCLI; git checkout <previous-sha>; npm ci --ignore-scripts
```

Data format is JSON with a `schema` field per file (`majin.v4.conversation/v1`,
`majin.v2.goal/v1`). `restore` refuses an unknown schema on purpose: a future format needs
a migration, not a guess.

## 7. Shutdown and offline behaviour

- `Ctrl+C` (or stopping the task) closes the listener; in-flight goals stay
  `RUNNING` on disk and are marked `BLOCKED` on next boot — never "completed".
- The phone shows an offline bar when `/api/state` fails and does not pretend
  messages were delivered.
- If the PC is off, the tunnel returns 502/1033; MAJIN cannot fake availability.
