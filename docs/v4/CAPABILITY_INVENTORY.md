## Capability domains

| Domain | What exists |
| --- | --- |
| tools | builtin: 9; v1Integrated: 115; registeredOnHost: 114 |
| skills | shipped: ["fix-code","job-search"]; mechanism: src/v4/skills.js — declared required/preferred tools decide visibility, not app code; learned: src/v4/learning.js — procedures extracted from goals that completed with an independently verified receipt; stored in the same skills directory with a `learned` block, so one loader serves both. States: EXPERIMENTAL, VERIFIED, REUSABLE, STALE, FAILED.; learnedAcceptance: npm run v4:learn-accept — the mandatory A–H gate against the real provider |
| mcp | state: configured by the owner in <data>/v4/mcp.json; mechanism: src/v4/mcp.js + mcp-tools.js — stdio JSON-RPC, scrubbed env, tools at process tier |
| agentFunctions | turnEngine: src/v4/agent.js — goal, rounds, receipts, verification, recovery advisor; discovery: tools_search + tools_activate (src/v4/tool-exposure.js); delegation: agent_delegate — bounded subagent, owner-gated; resume: resumeGoal — re-verifies every artifact against the recorded SHA-256 |
| computerControl | lanes: [{"lane":"desktop","available":false,"tools":0,"reason":"Windows-only (this host is linux)"},{"lane":"computer","available":false,"tools":0,"reason":"Windows-only (this host is linux)"},{"lane":"screen","available":false,"tools":0,"reason":"Windows-only (this host is linux)"}]; mechanism: V1 wincontrol.js / computer.js through the V1 lane adapter; Windows interactive session only |
| browser | lane: web; tools: ["browser.open","browser.read","browser.click","browser.form","browser.form_fill","browser.form_submit","browser.fill","browser.shot","browser.upload","browser.verify","browser.elements","browser.clear_marks","browser.close"]; runtime: {"available":false,"reason":"no browser binary found (npx playwright install chromium)"} |
| terminal | lanes: [{"lane":"shell","available":true,"tools":5},{"lane":"shelltools","available":true,"tools":5}]; mechanism: V1 exec.js (managed jobs) and shell.js (command/background) through the V2 runner and approvals |
| memory | tools: ["memory_save","memory_search"]; store: src/v2/memory/store.js (used directly); promptInjection: src/v4/memory.js memoryForPrompt — retrieval, not just writes |
| voice | server: src/v2/voice/{speak,listen,tts,stt}.js imported by src/v4/voice.js; client: browser-native speech + text fallback (src/v4/ui/voice.js); measured: false |
| automation | flows: 6; supervisor: src/v4/supervisor.js — crash recovery and health checks; updater: signed release, overlay activation, journal recovery, daily Windows task; scheduler: Windows Task Scheduler (logon host + daily update) |
| multiAgent | implemented: agent_delegate (1 level), agent_graph (V2 DAG), team_run (V1 standing teams, resumable); teams: V1 TeamStore + runTeam + runSwarm reused unchanged; members executed by V4 subagents; graph: V2 TaskGraph + runGraph reused unchanged, executed by V4 subagents; notUsed: V2 orchestrator/compiler/supervisor (they compile and plan for the V2 loop, which V4 does not run) |

## V1 tool modules

| Module | Tools | Lanes | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agent.js` | 4 | — | replaced | V1 agent.plan/delegate/moa/approve are bound to V1's own loop, registry and guard. V4 provides the same capability natively (agent_delegate) with its own approval policy; running V1's second agent runtime inside V4 would duplicate state and bypass receipts. |
| `audit.js` | 1 | audit | lane | reused through audit |
| `channels.js` | 1 | channels | lane | reused through channels |
| `computer.js` | 2 | computer | lane | reused through computer |
| `exec.js` | 5 | shell | lane | reused through shell |
| `files.js` | 13 | files | lane | reused through files |
| `flows.js` | 6 | flows | lane | reused through flows |
| `github.js` | 2 | github | lane | reused through github |
| `heartbeat.js` | 1 | — | replaced | The existing core Heartbeat engine is reused by src/v4/heartbeat.js with actual V4 goal/approval events, durable queue and shared-history/opt-in push delivery. The old tool wrapper uses V1 journal events and is not a second V4 heartbeat owner. |
| `jobs.js` | 9 | jobs | lane | reused through jobs |
| `learn.js` | 3 | learn | lane | reused through learn |
| `majin.js` | 18 | — | excluded | Self-configuration writes V1's config.json and restarts V1's agent. V4 has its own setup, doctor, owner-mode and updater. Adapting these would let the model edit the wrong configuration while appearing to manage MAJIN. |
| `marketing.js` | 4 | marketing | lane | reused through marketing |
| `memory-sync.js` | 1 | — | replaced | The existing core memory-sync entry point now supports canonical V2 namespaced records. V4 memory_sync uses that engine and MemoryStore with approval, folder checks and tombstones. The old wrapper assumes V1 text facts and is not used to create a shadow V4 store. |
| `meta.js` | 1 | — | replaced | tools.search needs V1's registry.search. V4 ships tools_search/tools_activate over the live V4 registry, which also makes discovered tools callable in the next round. |
| `net.js` | 8 | screen, net | lane | reused through screen, net |
| `power.js` | 3 | power | lane | reused through power |
| `re.js` | 23 | re | lane | reused through re |
| `research.js` | 1 | research | lane | reused through research |
| `reset.js` | 2 | — | excluded | Deletes artifacts measured by V1 recovery inside a shared data dir. V4 reconciles its own goals and must never run destructive V1 recovery on paths it does not own. |
| `shell.js` | 5 | shelltools | lane | reused through shelltools |
| `sys.js` | 6 | sys | lane | reused through sys |
| `teams.js` | 2 | — | replaced | The V1 tool wrapper binds team.run to V1's loop and registry. Its ENGINE (src/core/teams.js: TeamStore, runTeam) and the scheduler behind it (src/core/swarm.js) are reused verbatim by V4's team_run, with V4 subagents as the worker. |
| `trading.js` | 2 | trading | lane | reused through trading |
| `web.js` | 16 | web | lane | reused through web |
| `wincontrol.js` | 5 | desktop | lane | reused through desktop |

| `src/v2/exec/whitelist.js` | not-used | Command whitelisting for the V2 executor; V4's shell tools run through V1's executor and V4 approvals. |

| `src/v2/ops/doctor.js` | not-used | All checks are V2-specific (V2 binary, OpenCode key, Studio port). |
| `src/v2/recover/advisor.js` | reused | imported by src/v2/recover/outer-loop.js, src/v4/agent.js |
| `src/v2/recover/outer-loop.js` | not-used | Drives V2's runObjective; V4 runs its own loop and reuses only recover/advisor.js. |

## V3 components

| Component | Status | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/v3/platform/runtime.js` | not-used | Node >= 22 check; V4 performs the same check in assertNodeSupported(). |
| `src/v3/runtime/file-deliverable.js` | not-used | V3's file vertical slice is V4's workspace_write + V2 file verifier, with approvals and receipts added. |
| `src/v3/server.js` | not-used | V3's single-purpose HTTP server (one file deliverable). V4's server supersedes it. |
| `src/v3/ui/page.js` | not-used | V3's static page for the file-deliverable demo; V4 has the PWA. |
