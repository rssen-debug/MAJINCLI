# Final execution checkpoint — NOT READY

The requested complete product has not passed acceptance. No requirement is waived,
and PR401 remains draft and unmerged. This checkpoint supersedes older aggregate
claims where they conflict; the complete original requirements remain in
FINAL_RELEASE_REPORT.md, FINAL_FEATURE_PARITY.md and HANDOVER_CONTINUE.md.

## Changes in this execution

- Match the memory-sync root resolver to Windows native path normalization,
  including overlap/alias rejection before any store identity or data write.
- Browser observations report bounded, value-hidden native field validity.
  Observation does not dispatch validation events. Post-click output distinguishes
  a dispatched action from a verified submission.
- A no-op select fill no longer dispatches change/input, preserving dependent
  fields. Real DOM regression verifies this and native validation/privacy.
- Controlled real-model receipts now retain tool input/result traces for diagnosis.
  These traces concern generated local fixture data only.

## Evidence

- Focused real DOM/select/memory tests: 13 passed, zero failed/skipped.
- Browser suite: 124 passed, zero failed, four skipped (128 total).
- Parse: 656/656; i18n: zero stray Swedish literals in 335 files.
- Real Go form attempts 6 and 7: FAIL, 12-round budget exhausted.
- Attempt 8: FAIL, bounded evaluation approval budget exhausted, even with a
  separately declared 24-round/32-call ceiling. One actual multipart submission
  reached the expected server-side validation challenge, with the generated upload;
  no accepted registration or saved verified receipt. This is progress evidence,
  not acceptance. Earlier failures remain. All hosts were isolated disposable
  Ghost test instances; the selected Go provider/model was unchanged.
- Original config/key/pairing/data preservation: 23 checked files unchanged;
  39 restored backup hashes match. No scraper or personal-data cleanup was run.
- Previous pushed head 52d5d04: V4 CI and runner passed; Windows CI failed its
  overlap-path assertion (571 passed, one failed, one skipped). Packaging/native
  and cold-start stages were skipped on that head. This execution fixes that
  assertion's path handling; the new head needs its own CI results.

## Mandatory remaining gates

1. Complete autonomous forms, factual research correction, real desktop execution,
   durable orchestration restart/replan, complete physical mobile execution and
   two eligible model routing/billing acceptance. No claim of universal success.
2. Verify account eligibility/Extra Usage protection; model catalogue is not proof.
3. Actual locked-iPhone push receipt/opening (zero subscriptions at last check),
   speech interruption, explicit 5G reconnect and Ghost microphone/playback.
4. Activate prepared audit/heartbeat/channels/memory-sync in the ordinary Ghost
   process. Last activated runtime e45640a; prepared source is newer. Audit and
   heartbeat endpoints still returned 404 at the last ordinary-host audit.
   Relevant real channel accounts and external audit witness remain unverified.
5. Typed self-configuration/reset, durable graphs, team token/currency budgets,
   remaining OCR/preview/DPI parity. Legacy reset guards are not accepted as safe.
6. Memory backup/restore must preserve sync versions/deletion tombstones and
   preflight memory before any restore writes. Existing export/restore was found
   to omit tombstones/replay put; this execution does not claim that gap repaired.
7. Approved production signing identity/channel, trusted native Ghost installation,
   login startup, actual automatic host/app update activation and rollback.
8. Exact new-head CI and the full original acceptance/release chain.

Automatic review rejected the previously planned ordinary-host child restart with
“blocked by policy.” It has not been bypassed. Prepared source and isolated tests
are not ordinary-host activation evidence; unsigned packages are not trusted releases.

## Final local suite result

Full V4: 574 tests, 567 passed, zero failed, seven skipped. Skips are the
Playwright Chromium-dependent phone/e2e, heartbeat (two), touch, selector and
voice (two) cases: the pinned headless-shell executable is absent. Actual installed
Chrome DOM tests above did run. Skipped physical/mobile gates are not accepted.
The diagnostic trace retention refinement was syntax-checked after these runs;
it preserves events when evaluation throws instead of discarding partial traces.
