# Universal Agent completion audit

Scope: the Universal Agent / Grand Architect specification, sections 1–11 and
acceptance A–J, reviewed against source and executed evidence on 2026-10-25.
This is an open implementation audit, not a completion certificate. The earlier
seven-flow `ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX.json` describes its own fixtures and does not prove
the broader A–J checklist or an autonomous 500-employer workflow.

| Requirement | Current authoritative evidence | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Preserve useful tools and authorization boundaries | V5 owner grants; deterministic Codex/Go worker; browser origin and realpath regression tests | Broader tool coverage and external account sessions must be verified individually |
| 2 Reuse and evidence-backed research | `inventory.js`, `REUSE_MATRIX.md`, `RESEARCH_DECISIONS.md`; shared V1/V2/V4 tools and verifiers | Review stale research claims and every newly adopted dependency; no trend alone justifies adoption |
| 3 General execution and application processing | Real Go model tool loop; `workflows/job-search.js`; real browser upload test | Model-driven persistent multi-site queue, multiple legitimate sources, live vacancy validation and transparent ranking need integrated acceptance |
| 4 Unified tool registry | Worker exposes actual available tools and input schemas | Cost, measured reliability, output contracts, failures and verification metadata are not yet unified for every tool |
| 5 Observe, verify, recover and checkpoint | `provider-agent.js`; failure/recovery, cancellation, checkpoint HTTP/reconstruction tests; live DeepSeek resume proof | Dependency-aware plans, pause and long-task continuation need broader integration; default round budget requires explicit continuation |
| 6 Useful bounded delegation | Existing V2 scheduler and V5 DAG path use bounded concurrency | Provider-driven delegation, shared-session exclusion and measured benefit are not proven by that scheduler alone |
| 7 Verified reusable learning and XP | V5 learning, skill builder and receipt-ledger tests; file criteria gate completion | End-to-end model-driven skill creation, restart/retrieval, reuse and rollback must be demonstrated together |
| 8 Minimal truthful experience | Existing living orb UI, provider execution endpoint and Windows Chromium CI | Confirm each live state/steering/voice path against current runtime; no background animation is task evidence |
| 9 Outcome acceptance | Controlled browser multipart/hash test, live model file tasks, Windows UI CI | See A–J below; all ten are not yet proven |
| 10 Incremental tested changes | Dedicated branches and PR checks; no failing increment merged | Keep new increments separate and inspect final head checks before merging |
| 11 Final evidence report | Versioned docs, commands, CI and private live traces | Final requirement-by-requirement report remains open until acceptance is complete |

| Acceptance | Evidence and limit |
| --- | --- |
| A Browser | Real Chromium native form/radio/select/upload test, scoped write denial and unique selectors pass; full navigation/recovery suite remains |
| B Desktop | Earlier physical Notepad test has independent contents/screenshot evidence; repeatable current-engine desktop acceptance remains |
| C Coding | Live selected-provider file tools and independent verifier work; build/run/test small application acceptance remains |
| D Research | Real public fetch works; source URL presence alone is insufficient to prove a correct cited comparison |
| E Mock hiring | Real browser multipart file bytes verified; autonomous multi-step portal failure recovery remains |
| F Memory/skills | Component tests exist; autonomous learn/restart/retrieve/reuse lifecycle remains |
| G Interruptions | Cancellation tests and live DeepSeek resume with same goal, original checks and exactly-once observed append pass; explicit pause/redirect matrix remains |
| H Voice | Activation and interruption controller tests do not prove actual recognition, playback or physical microphone operation |
| I Security/reliability | Path confinement, malformed calls, repeated failures, revocation, restart uncertainty and cross-origin denial tested; full adversarial acceptance remains |
| J UI | Windows real Chromium and installer CI pass; inspect actual mobile/Windows visuals and state changes for final acceptance |

Live personal documents, keys and employer records stay outside the repository.
Controlled hiring tests must not be counted as real employer applications.

## Additional source review

[REA](https://github.com/morluto/rea) was inspected as an optional analysis tool:
its README describes MCP/CLI evidence-oriented inspection and MIT-authored code
with separate third-party terms. Its documented Node floors and native-tool
requirements add compatibility/deployment work. Decision: adapt the
evidence-plus-follow-up inspection concept; defer installing its runtime until a
specific authorized software-analysis task needs it and dependency/security/
performance checks are completed. No REA code or commercial native-tool license
is incorporated.

[Trendshift](https://trendshift.io/) was checked for discovery only. Popularity
does not establish license compatibility, maintenance quality or task success.
[Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) remains a procedural-memory
design reference; introducing its separate Python execution loop would conflict
with the shared deterministic MAJIN tool runtime. No new third-party framework
was installed during the checkpoint increment.
